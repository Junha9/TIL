## compare objects

- == (equal)
  
  - return True if two variables have same value

- is (identical)
  
  - return True if two variables refers the same object



## Instance method

`def instance_method(self, arg1, ...)`

First argument would be set to self when the method is called

**self**

- Instance itself. the code can be excuted even if the name is not self, but it's a common rule



## Magic method (special method)

- methods with double underscore(____)

- will be automatically called in specific situation

- ex) `__str__(self)` , `__len__(self)` , `__repr(self)__`, `__gt__(self, other)`

- 



## Class method

Method that class will use

define with `@classmethod` decorater

cls(class) will be the first argument when it's called



## Decorater

decorate a function with another function, give another operation to the function

write `@decoraterfunctionname` on above of the function

the order is crucial.



## Static method

method that doesn't call instance variable neither class variable

used when define a method just to excute certian statement and not handle the attribute



## Inheritance

`isinstance(object, classinfo)`

return True if object is the instance or the subcalss of classinfo

`issubclass(class,classinfo)`

return True if class is the subclass of classinfo

classinfo could be tuple

`super()`

call the parent class in the child class



### multiple inheritance

if one class inherit from more than one different classes, it can use all method and attribute from its parents

if there's an existing method or attribute, it will be decided by inherit order

- mro method
  
  - check the list of parent classes



### Encapsulation

block the access of certain information
it's a tacit in python, but its not official in langugage system.

- ### public acces modifier
  
  - public member: method or attribute that doesn't start with '_'
  
  - can be called in everywhere, allow override in inherited class
  
  - most of the method and attribute

- ### protected acces modifier
  
  - protected member: method or attribute that starts with '_'
  
  - can be called in parents class and inherited class by tacit rule
  
  - can be override in inherited class

- ### private acces modifier
  
  - private member: method or attribute that starts with '__'
  
  - only can be used inside of the class
  
  - can't be inherited or called in inherited class
  
  - can't be called outside of the class

### getter and setter method

- getter method: method that reads the value of the variable

- `@property` decorater

- setter method: method that set the value of the variable

- `@variable.setter`
